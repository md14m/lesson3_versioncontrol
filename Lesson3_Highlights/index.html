            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Version control basically allows you to have one main repository for all files. It's an easier way to locate all your files. Especially when working with teammates, it becomes easier to check on the progress of your files using one repository for multiple users. This way, the file sharing problem is solves, and all files can be found in the same repository. It will note who changes certain files, when they were changed, what about them has changed, along with merging these changes to the same file. This way, if anything has changed, you would know how and why.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Benefits</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many benefits of using version control. For starters, there is no way a file can be overwritten. The common repository contains all the latest files in their latest format and editions, and it is possible for more than one person to be working on the same file without there being any conflict or impediment. You also have the ability to revert back to older versions, just in case you didn't like a certain change you made. Although using version control is definitely better when working with other people, it is not necessary to have a group project to use. Even without having other people to work with it is useful to use because of how secure your files are, along with many versions of them. You’ll never lose your work!</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There is a remote repository and a local repository. When new repositories are created, these changes are recorded. The remote repository can be located on a remote server that can be shared among many other people if necessary, where as, in difference, the local repository exists on the local machine of an individual user. You would use the remote repository to publish to the world or a large amount of users, while also allowing them to read and write in it. The local repository is only involved when you push local commits to a remote repository, or when you pull someone’s commits from a remote repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a version control system that is free to use. It is designed to handle with great efficiency any sort of files for projects, whether they be large or small. It’s super easy to learn! It allows you to store your data on a single repository, while being local, so it’s easy to work off of it. It never fails! Everything flows in faster processes, while also preventing files from being overwritten. The three basic steps when using GIT are: add, commit, and push. These steps allow you to add information, commit by confirming, also allow you to push information, transferring files to other places.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Three States</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One of the most important things about GIT is the fact that it has three states, committed, modified, and staged. Committed, like it sounds, means that your data is safely stored in the repository. Modified, also like it sounds, means that your data has been changed in some sort of way and has yet to be committed. Staged means that a certain modified file has been marked in it’s current version with intention of going into your next commit snapshot. Data is stored in the GIT directory. This is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer, which is known to be the most important part.</p>
